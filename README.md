# Breast Cancer Classification

Machine learning project to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign using diagnostic data. This project leverages data preprocessing, feature analysis, and multiple ML models to help detect cancer early and accurately.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore tumor features and patterns
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Implementation of multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC
- Visualizations of tumor features, correlations, and confusion matrices

## Dataset
Uses the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data), which contains diagnostic measurements for tumors labeled as malignant or benign.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/breast-cancer-classification.git
